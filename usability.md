# Usability & Accessibility

In the process of developing the project, I made the following improvements to enhance usability and accessibility:

## Usability Enhancements:
1. **Clear Page Layout**: Using the `goToPage()` function to switch between pages (e.g., register, login, dashboard, create thread, etc.) ensures that users can easily navigate through the application.
2. **Clear Button Functions**: Buttons like "Register," "Login," "Logout," etc., are clearly labeled, helping users intuitively understand their actions.
3. **Real-time UI Updates**: After editing a thread or submitting a comment, the thread content section is immediately refreshed, giving users instant feedback on their actions and enhancing the interactive experience.

## Accessibility Enhancements:
1. **Form Fields with Labels**: The input fields in the register and login forms have clear text labels (e.g., "Email," "Password"), making it easier for screen reader users to understand the form contents.
2. **Clear Button Labels**: All action buttons are labeled with intuitive text, ensuring that users relying on screen readers can understand their purpose.
3. **Media Queries and Responsive Design**: Media queries have been applied for different devices, ensuring better usability on smaller screens (like mobile devices).
